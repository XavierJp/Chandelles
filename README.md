# Kindle-the-stars
Hi. I love stars and constellations. Here is my attempt at making a simple sky map linked with wikipedia.
The map is initially centered on Paris, France.

It is based on d3-celestial data available [here](https://github.com/ofrohn/d3-celestial)

## Known issues
- data still need a huge clean.

## What it can't do (yet)
- focus & articles on stars **(soon)**

## Architecture
The code is split in two main parts :
- a react app that handle 
- a d3 chart that plot the stars and constellations.

The d3Chart could be esaily split from react and integrated with any other front end framework.
